## 🧐 What is this?
The **BCSU** is a cutting-edge C++ software solution designed to unlock hidden hardware capabilities in PC towers. It utilizes the `winmm` API to repurpose the *Optical Disc Drive* (ODD) into a high-tensile, retractable platform specifically engineered for holding:
* Coffee mugs
* Energy drink cans (330ml / 500ml standard)
* Small potted cacti

## 🚀 Features
* **Zero-UI Interface:** Runs silently in the background. No bloatware.
* **Instant Deployment:** Tray deployment speed limited only by the 12V DC motor of your hardware.
* **Legacy Support:** Works on any Windows machine that still remembers what a CD is.
* **Safety First:** Does absolutely no checking if there is already a cup on the tray before closing (feature pending).

## 🛠 Installation & Usage

## ⚠️ Warning
